# Chapter 5: Embodied Intelligence

## Understanding Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is a fundamental principle in Physical AI that posits intelligence emerges from the dynamic interaction between an agent's cognitive processes, its physical body, and the environment in which it operates. Unlike traditional AI approaches that treat intelligence as abstract computation, embodied intelligence emphasizes that the physical form and environmental context are essential components of intelligent behavior.

This perspective suggests that intelligence is not solely a property of the "mind" or computational system, but rather arises from the coupling of perception, action, and environmental dynamics. The body serves not merely as an output device for a separate intelligent system, but as an integral part of the intelligent process itself.

## Theoretical Foundations
