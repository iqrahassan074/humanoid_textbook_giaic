# Chapter 2: Robotics and AI Integration

## The Convergence of Robotics and AI

Robotics and artificial intelligence have evolved as complementary fields that together form the foundation of Physical AI. Robotics provides the physical embodiment and mechanical capabilities, while AI contributes the cognitive and decision-making abilities. Their integration creates systems capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the physical world.

The synergy between these fields has led to significant advances in autonomous systems, enabling robots to perform increasingly complex tasks in dynamic environments. This integration is not merely additive but multiplicative, creating capabilities that neither field could achieve independently.
